## Setup
1. tensorflow > 1.9.0
2. dataflow --> tensorpack 
link: https://github.com/tensorpack

## Description

### 1. Training/testing/evaluating sh scripts:
usage: sh command_train(evaluate/test)_dcase2019.sh

### 2. Data preparation:
Use sequence_generation.py to produce Log-Mel spec sequence for each audio wav data.
The ./utils/dataloader.py script is used to load the generated sequence into the network. It is implemented by using the interface "datasets" of tensorpack. The dataset class declarition is in ./utils/datasets/SpecAudioDataset.py.

### 3. Pretrained models:
The pretrained models are in the ./pretrained_models. We modified the example of ResNet for ImageNet in https://github.com/tensorpack/tensorpack/tree/master/examples/ResNet to get the pretrained 2D ResNet-18 and PreAct-18.

### 4. Transform ResNet-18 into SeNoT-Net:
The SeNoT-Net definition is in ./models/resnet18_senot_128_80.py, which will load the pre-trained models and transform them into SeNoT-Nets by calling the methods in ./tf_utils.py.

### 5. SeNoT module:
The Semantic Neighbor Selector (SeNS) is worked as an operation in the SeNoT-Net. The codes are in the ./tf_ops.
This operation is modified from the CPNet in https://github.com/xingyul/cpnet.

### 6. Train/test the model:
Use ./train.py and ./test.py to train and test the model.
